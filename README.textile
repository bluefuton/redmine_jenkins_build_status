*The master branch is compatible with Redmine 2.x only.* If you're still using Redmine 1.x, use the 'redmine-1.x' branch.

h2. Installation

Clone into Redmine's plugins folder.

Inside the plugin's config folder, copy jenkins.example.yml to jenkins.yml and add your Jenkins JSON API URL to it. Also, add your credentials to it (if applicable). For example:

<pre>
production:
  api_url: http://jenkins.example.com/api/json
  username: my_name
  password: my_pass
</pre>

If authentication is not required, the username and password can be omitted.

h2. Conventions

The project identifier used in Jenkins must match the project identifier used in Redmine.
